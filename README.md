## Introduction

This is a forked version of `ethstaker-deposit-cli` tool for the LUKSO Mainnet and Testnet networks.

`ethstaker-deposit-cli` is a tool for creating [EIP-2335 format](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335) BLS12-381 keystores and a corresponding `deposit_data*.json` file for [Ethereum Staking Launchpad](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-launchpad) or the [Gnosis Beacon Chain deposit UI](https://github.com/gnosischain/gbc-deposit-ui/). One can also provide a keystore file to generate a `signed_exit_transaction*.json` file to be broadcast at a later date to exit a validator.

- **Warning: Please generate your keystores on your own safe, completely offline device.**
- **Warning: Please backup your mnemonic, keystores, and password securely.**

Please read [Launchpad Validator FAQs](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/faq#keys) before generating the keys.

You can read [the security assessment report by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2024-12-ethstaker-depositcli-securityreview.pdf) that was completed on December 13, 2024.

## Canonical Deposit Contract and Launchpad

Ethstaker confirms the canonical Ethereum staking deposit contract addresses and launchpad URLs.
Please be sure that your LYX is deposited only to this deposit contract address, depending on chain.

Depositing to the wrong address **will** lose you your LYX.

  - Deposit address: [0xCAfe00000000000000000000000000000000CAfe](https://explorer.execution.mainnet.lukso.network/address/0xCAfe00000000000000000000000000000000CAfe)
  - [Launchpad](https://deposit.mainnet.lukso.network)
